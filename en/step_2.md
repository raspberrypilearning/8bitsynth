## What you will need

### Hardware

* An Arduino (Preferably Uno, although others are possible) 
* Breadboard 470Ω resistor 
* Tactile button 
* 4 × 10kΩ linear potentiometers (usually marked B10K)

## Installing the software
Go to [sensorium.github.io/Mozzi](http://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi) and click on the download link. This will take you to an optional donation page where you can help the author of the library out if you choose. You’ll then be taken to the GitHub project page for Mozzi. Click the ‘Source Code.zip’ link, download the zip file, and extract the contents to your Arduino/libraries directory (this is usually in your documents folder).

Your file structure should then look like this: Documents/Arduino/Libraries/Mozzi-1.0.3 (although you may have a different version).
